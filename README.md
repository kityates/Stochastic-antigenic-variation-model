Stochastic-antigenic-variation-model
====================================

The code contained within this repository is designed to simulate antigenic variation using a fully stochastic model. The code runs a tau-leaping simulation of a bespoke model of anitgenic variation. This approximate simulation method allows us to simulate the full dynamics of the stochastic system in a realistic time (in comparison to the full stochastic simulation algorithm) .
